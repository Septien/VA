displaying the plots.
Some plots:
	-Histogram.
	-3D Scatterplot.
	-2D Scatterplot.
	-Boxplot.
	-Osciloscope.
	-Pieplot.
	-Gauge*.
	-Bubble chart* (can be used to display clusters).
	-Line plot.
	-Area plot.

*see Google charts for reference.

TODO:
	-Add labels to (all) plots.
	-Give a 'pro' format.
    -Treat stepped area plot as a bar graph. That is, the x-axis variable is a
    qualitative variable, meaning that it represents non-numeric data.
    -Add interactivity to plots. Hint: Add a subclass with contains the canvas and the
    necesary controls for manipulate it.
    -Start investigating about web services, Web GUI, WebGL, etc.
